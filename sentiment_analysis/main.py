# WIP!!
# TODO: 
#   Analyze comments in batches rather than one by one, we may lose some accuracy tho
#   Parallelize the code
#   Find some faster models in: https://huggingface.co/models
#   Write in DynamoDB
#   May add number of reactions per post, but, so far it's replaced with reactions sentiment (both per post and per channel)
